Note that these model files were provided by Aakash Gupta as part of a larger
set of model files (48 cores, 21 parameter C_ij) for use in testing related to
SeisFlows Issue #245. I only took a subset of those model files for testing
purposes so the underlying model here makes no sense and is not complete, but is
small enough and useful enough for testing the Model class in SeisFlows.
